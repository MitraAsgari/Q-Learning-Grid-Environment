# Q-Learning-Grid-Environment
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Q-Learning algorithm to solve a grid-based environment problem. The environment consists of a 4x4 grid where an agent learns to navigate from the starting position to the goal position by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.
